Reservation Roulette app repo

## To install
From the root directory, run 
```
npm install
```
This should install all of the project dependencies, plus the Expo tool set.

You're also going to need to download the Expo Go app on your phone to test the app out in development. Go here from your phone to download the app:
```
https://expo.dev/client
```

## Running the app locally
From the root directory, run
```
expo start
```
This should create a QR code that you can scan with the Expo Go app to run the app on your phone. Expo Go will simulate what the app will look like when it's running independently (though before we put this app on any app store, we'll have to eject it from the Expo system and build independent Android and Apple versions of it).
